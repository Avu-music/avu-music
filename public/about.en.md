title: 'Everyone has a story to tell...'
---

Hey, my name is Bj√∂rn and like many kids, I grew up with video games, movies and books. Getting lost in new worlds, witness characters evolve into heroes and villains or getting surprised by an unexpected plot twist inspired me, and music was always my creative voice since I picked up my first instrument as a kid. I still remember standing up from my couch after freeing Epona in Ocarina of Time and riding through the plains, the feeling of immersing myself in a galaxy far, far away after listening to the Star Wars main theme in a cinema for the first time or crying in front of my grandparents TV, while watching Simba loose his father in "The Lion King".

To recapture these memories and feelings, to connect and bond with the audience fascinated me increasingly more with every project I worked on and with every story I tried to emphasize without words. While my day job as a social worker required me to listen and support people through difficult times, expressing myself through my music and helping other creatives share their message with their audience, was something I started to gradually put more and more focus on, until I transitioned to work as a full time musician, composing for film and creating adaptive music systems for game developers, in the beginning of 2023.

The different aspects, that resonate with people, can be subtle, overwhelming, soft or on the nose. It can be an emotional outburst or a small detail that we'll think about for weeks without knowing why. These moments can stay with us for decades. They inspire us, move us to tears and make us laugh.
I want to support your vision and create these moments for you.

**It's your story to tell and my job to make people listen to it.**
